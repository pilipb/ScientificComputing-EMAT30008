The solvers (solvers.py) that I have implemented are single step integrators using Euler, Runge-Kutta and Heun methods. These methods provide different accuracies (with Heun and RK4 being much more accurate than Euler). The functions are incorporated in the solve_to method which allows the integration of a function between 2 times. The functions take any number of dimensions as long as the function is provided in a first order form, with args. As these form the building blocks of much of the code in this module, there are input checks to ensure that the correct data types are being fed into these functions by higher level code, and therefore making errors more traceable.

These values are adjusted by a solver until all the conditions for a limit cycle are met: the start and end values for each variable are equal, and the derivative at the start of the solution for the first variable is equal to zero. Originally the shooting method was created as a single function, however, this was split into two functions to allow for the shooting setup to be called by the continuation methods. The shooting setup function takes the initial guess for the solution and the starting parameters (An arbitrary intial estimate of period is used) and returns the function to be solved by the root finding method in continuation, in the form F(u) = 0. This function can then be solved by scipy's `root` or numpy's `linalg.solve`. \n",

    "The continuation methods are then called by the continuation class. The continuation class takes the problem, the discretisation method, the root finding method, the step size, the maximum number of steps, the starting point and the starting parameter. The inputs have been decided on to ensure that new continuation methods (prior to pseudo-arclength) could be easily added. The starting point and starting parameter are used to define the initial guess for the solution. In addition, on creating of the class the solver and discretisation methods are defined. This allows the user to choose between the different methods available, as all the modules are designed to have the same inputs and outputs. With more time, the pseudo-arclength continuation method would call a shooting method to get the function to be solved, and then solve this using the root finding method.\n",

    "    What will I do differently in the future?\n",
    "    You will probably find it helpful to make notes on the answers to these questions each week.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical algorithms that I have learnt about are shooting, continuation, and numerically solving ODE's and PDE's. Although prior to this module I had an understanding of ODE's and PDE's, I had never implemented them numerically or looked at the difference between steady state and diffusive problems. As a result, this module has taught me about the concepts of limit cycles and how to calculate them numerically. I think that a prior understanding of limit cycles would have aided the code development as I feel that a large proportion of my time was spent trying to understand what the output of the code should be. This is the same for continuation, as the outputs first appeared highly abstract and it took a long time for me to understand how to formulate the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, I think that I now have a rough understanding of the mathematical concepts, but my understanding of the software principles that have been required is much greater. Due to the complexity of the problems, I have had to ensure that my code is well documented and structured so that I can follow it best. \n",
    "\n",
    "I have found the PDE and BVP sections of the module to be less challenging as I understood what the output should be and how to implement the code. I think that this is due to the fact that I had completed a similar module, wherein I had to derive the stepping formulas for the ODE's and PDE's. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Software Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "I started by writing plain scripts with small functions to make sure I got a minimum working script, once that worked I went back and re wrote all the files to contain a handful of functions needed to solve the relevant problems. This allowed me to make sure the code worked before adding the complexity of classes and methods. Eventually I went back through the code and added classes to the large problems in order to make them very modular and allow easier addition of new methods and problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding classes was simple once the code was working as the functions that existed could be moved into parts of a class. I found that once I made the classes, adding more code to each class became much simpler, as all the definitions: inputs and outputs were already defined. This sped up the development process towards the end of the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, I found that by using github actions, I was able to test the code every time I pushed to the repository. This allowed me to catch errors early and fix them due to the quick notifications I received from github. However, I found that had I implemented more tests throughout the module, development and tracking errors in new code would have been easier. Fortunately, the tests implemented ensured that input errors in the most low level functions would be flagged which made debugging higher level functions a lot easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I found that putting in the hard work of modularising the code early on allowed for the code to be easily developed and new methods and problems to be added easily afterwards. I know that in future software development projects I will aim to outline the inputs and outputs to all the problems I face, in a modular fashion (like classes), prior to writing the code. I also will aim to implement tests as I go, for the duration of a project, as this will allow for errors to be caught early and fixed quickly everytime I attempt to add new code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Short and Long Term Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "Short-term, this project ran alongside my dissertation in which I was developing a mathematical model of a hydropower turbine. What I learnt through this module - namely good practice for developement and modularity - transferred into making that model highly modular and parametric with clear inputs and outputs. That code is highly parametric and modular, and as a result, was easy to conduct sensitivity analysis on. Additionally, I've gained a greater understanding of github actions, continuous integration and testing. Having the skills to set this up would not have been possible without this unit as I did not know this existed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Long-term, the benefits of what I learnt are very similar. I will be able to develop code in a modular fashion and test it as I go. In the future I aim to work in software development to some extent, therefore having such a clear understanding of good coding practices will be critical. Additionally, the use of existing packages has allowed me to better understand how to use external tools to my advantage during the development and testing of my own projects. Having used many of the modules prior to this project, I thought that I had a good understanding of how to use them. However, through this project I have learnt how to correctly use the documentation and structure of existing modules to both implement them and to structure my code in a similar way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Would I Have Done Differently / Will Do Differently?\n",
    "\n",
    "If I started the unit again, I would have started by writing clear plans for each function, thereby allowing inputs, outputs and methods to be clearly defined prior to coding. I did this towards the end of the unit, however, I believe it would have saved a large amount of time if I had done this from the start. Specifically for the shooting and continuation methods, I would have explored examples in more detail prior to coding. I found that I had to spend a lot of time trying to understand the output of the code, which slowed down the development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, I think it would be beneficial to the coding process, had I implemeted each new feature for a very basic example. In the future, I would therefore try to define a list of simple problems and solutions for each feature of programming that I wish to implement. This would allow every new feature to be tested - this is test-driven development. I think that test driven development would have ensured that I understood the purpose of each function that I was implementing. This is something I struggled with during the unit, as for many of the features I was unsure of the inputs and outputs until I had written the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final thing that would have benefitted me in this module would have been to create a hierarchical / block diagram of the relationships between the various methods implemented prior to development. This would have allowed the creation of common parent classes and therefore more modularity between the various methods. In hindsight, I think it would have been good to integrate the continuation, bvps and pdes under a common parent class, as they are differential equations in either steady state or diffusive form. \n",
